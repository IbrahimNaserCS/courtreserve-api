# Database Revision (Ramblings)
Issue with the database is I am gonna be storing a lot of redundant information in regards to what I actually need to store there. Each court really just needs to know what times are already reserved/taken. The front end can decide what is free. So essentially the court needs to know the court id, name, and list of reservations. So when the front end is trying to populate, it needs to know what dates are already taken. So when a get request comes to /court/:courtid, you return all of the time blocks that are reserved for that court. The front end will basically find out dates from the day of the request up until lets just say one month for simplicities sake, that are not in those reservations. Maybe for now, you can reserve a whole day. The other feature can be added later. So it returns the days that are already taken so React knows which of the days for the current month are gonna show up as reserved. So what I need to do is edit the reservations to remove the time essentially since we are only looking at date. I also need to get only the ones that are active reservations of course. But when would I mark it as inactive? An active reservation is just one that is upcoming. The only time it would be marked inactive is when the user does it manually so I don't need to worry about that actually. So yes, it will be default yes when I add something to the database.
